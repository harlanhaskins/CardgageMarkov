| [[Senor Mortgage]] (2004)
| Greeting a commercial viewer.

| Calls Strong Bad "Israel". Second sentence is grammatically correct, but it's possible he means "lemonade" or "[[melonade]]" instead of "marmalade", as they make more sense in context. (Notably, Homestar has accidentally used "marmalade" in place of "melonade" in [[Fluffy Puff Commercial]].)

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- valign=top

| [[Dangeresque 3: The Criminal Projective]] (2008)

| [[hremail3184]] (2009)

| "Hello, Chi Minh?"
| [[A Decemberween Mackerel]] (2010)

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- valign=top
| "You might paste away if you Dinty Moore."
| [[A Decemberween Mackerel]] (2010)
| Related to the audience by Strong Bad as an example of Senor Cardgage's incoherent speech.
| "Paste away" is uncommon, it may or may not be a variant of "waste away". Dinty Moore, a kind of beef stew, is being used as a verb. It also sounds as though he's saying "didn't eat more", especially in the context of Strong Bad's repeat of the line. It could also mean that Strong Bad will "pass away" if he "didn't eat more".
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- valign=top
| "You rally might, Pez dispenser."
| [[A Decemberween Mackerel]] (2010)
| Responding to Strong Bad's skepticism of the line mentioned above.
| "Rally" instead of "really". He seems to be warning Strong Bad about something, although it's unknown what it means. Strong Bad is refered to as "Pez dispenser"; this may be because of Senor's habit of giving those around him bizarre nicknames, or because he's dying and may be hallucinating Strong Bad is actually a Pez dispenser.
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- valign=top
| "Oh, my grabness grabness! It really is a Decemberween Mackerel!"
| [[A Decemberween Mackerel]] (2010)
| Cured of whatever ailment he claimed to have.
