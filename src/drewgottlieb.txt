I keep seeing all of these "today's my last day interning at Microsoft... amazing summer... etc" posts on Facebook and I'm just thinking "No! Stop! Let me stay in denial!"
Incidentally, today's my last day interning at Microsoft, and I've had the best summer of my life.
The Of Monsters and Men concert last night was probably the best concert I've been to all summer. They sounded way better live than they do recorded, and I didn't think that'd be possible! It was such a treat.
My dream last night was about keeping Windows setting lists in sync. My work is starting to absorb me.
I don't remember exactly who made me aware of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, but this is the best show I've binged watched in a long time.
Well, it's the only show I've binge watched in a long time, but let's not let that fact get in the way here.
Got a free Fitz & The Tantrums concert at work today. Only two weeks left, gonna miss this place.
Our team is literally encouraged to look at Reddit during work today. Little do they know, I do that anyway! I know, I know, I'm such an overachiever
They said to look at Twitter, Reddit, etc, for people talking about our respective features, for both good and bad feedback (bugs). We're told not to respond to people directly, which is reasonable.
And by "we", I mean the larger full-time Windows team. I don't personally have any features that have shipped yet.
